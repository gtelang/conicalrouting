This code implements conical routing for computing lookahead paths in domains having 
stalactites and stalagmites. A lookahead path is one in which each point on the path
can see a significant chunk of the path ahead of it. This problem is important in the
era of driverless cars. See main.pdf for details. 

To execute the code, go to src/conical-routing.py and run using 
Python 2.7. You will need to have the Python CGAL bindings installed
along with auxiliary modules like colorama.
